[[remoting]]
== Remoting and web services using Spring




[[remoting-introduction]]
=== Introduction
Spring features integration classes for remoting support using various technologies. The
remoting support eases the development of remote-enabled services, implemented by your
usual (Spring) POJOs. Currently, Spring supports the following remoting technologies:

* __Remote Method Invocation (RMI)__. Through the use of the `RmiProxyFactoryBean` and
  the `RmiServiceExporter` Spring supports both traditional RMI (with `java.rmi.Remote`
  interfaces and `java.rmi.RemoteException`) and transparent remoting via RMI invokers
  (with any Java interface).
* __Spring's HTTP invoker__. Spring provides a special remoting strategy which allows
  for Java serialization via HTTP, supporting any Java interface (just like the RMI
  invoker). The corresponding support classes are `HttpInvokerProxyFactoryBean` and
  `HttpInvokerServiceExporter`.
* __Hessian__. By using Spring's `HessianProxyFactoryBean` and the
  `HessianServiceExporter` you can transparently expose your services using the
  lightweight binary HTTP-based protocol provided by Caucho.
* __Burlap__. Burlap is Caucho's XML-based alternative to Hessian. Spring provides
  support classes such as `BurlapProxyFactoryBean` and `BurlapServiceExporter`.
* __JAX-WS__. Spring provides remoting support for web services via JAX-WS (the
  successor of JAX-RPC, as introduced in Java EE 5 and Java 6).
* __JMS__. Remoting using JMS as the underlying protocol is supported via the
  `JmsInvokerServiceExporter` and `JmsInvokerProxyFactoryBean` classes.
* __AMQP__. Remoting using AMQP as the underlying protocol is supported by the Spring
  AMQP project.

While discussing the remoting capabilities of Spring, we'll use the following domain
model and corresponding services:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class Account implements Serializable{

		private String name;

		public String getName(){
			return name;
		}

		public void setName(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}

	}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface AccountService {

		public void insertAccount(Account account);

		public List<Account> getAccounts(String name);

	}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface RemoteAccountService extends Remote {

		public void insertAccount(Account account) throws RemoteException;

		public List<Account> getAccounts(String name) throws RemoteException;

	}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// the implementation doing nothing at the moment
	public class AccountServiceImpl implements AccountService {

		public void insertAccount(Account acc) {
			// do something...
		}

		public List<Account> getAccounts(String name) {
			// do something...
		}

	}
----

We will start exposing the service to a remote client by using RMI and talk a bit about
the drawbacks of using RMI. We'll then continue to show an example using Hessian as the
protocol.




[[remoting-rmi]]
=== Exposing services using RMI
Using Spring's support for RMI, you can transparently expose your services through the
RMI infrastructure. After having this set up, you basically have a configuration similar
to remote EJBs, except for the fact that there is no standard support for security
context propagation or remote transaction propagation. Spring does provide hooks for
such additional invocation context when using the RMI invoker, so you can for example
plug in security frameworks or custom security credentials here.



[[remoting-rmi-server]]
==== Exporting the service using the RmiServiceExporter

Using the `RmiServiceExporter`, we can expose the interface of our AccountService object
as RMI object. The interface can be accessed by using `RmiProxyFactoryBean`, or via
plain RMI in case of a traditional RMI service. The `RmiServiceExporter` explicitly
supports the exposing of any non-RMI services via RMI invokers.

Of course, we first have to set up our service in the Spring container:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="accountService" class="example.AccountServiceImpl">
		<!-- any additional properties, maybe a DAO? -->
	</bean>
----

Next we'll have to expose our service using the `RmiServiceExporter`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.remoting.rmi.RmiServiceExporter">
		<!-- does not necessarily have to be the same name as the bean to be exported -->
		<property name="serviceName" value="AccountService"/>
		<property name="service" ref="accountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
		<!-- defaults to 1099 -->
		<property name="registryPort" value="1199"/>
	</bean>
----

As you can see, we're overriding the port for the RMI registry. Often, your application
server also maintains an RMI registry and it is wise to not interfere with that one.
Furthermore, the service name is used to bind the service under. So right now, the
service will be bound at `'rmi://HOST:1199/AccountService'`. We'll use the URL later on
to link in the service at the client side.

[NOTE]
====
The `servicePort` property has been omitted (it defaults to 0). This means that an
anonymous port will be used to communicate with the service.
====



[[remoting-rmi-client]]
==== Linking in the service at the client
Our client is a simple object using the `AccountService` to manage accounts:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class SimpleObject {

		private AccountService accountService;

		public void setAccountService(AccountService accountService) {
			this.accountService = accountService;
		}

		// additional methods using the accountService

	}
----

To link in the service on the client, we'll create a separate Spring container,
containing the simple object and the service linking configuration bits:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="example.SimpleObject">
		<property name="accountService" ref="accountService"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="accountService" class="org.springframework.remoting.rmi.RmiProxyFactoryBean">
		<property name="serviceUrl" value="rmi://HOST:1199/AccountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----

That's all we need to do to support the remote account service on the client. Spring
will transparently create an invoker and remotely enable the account service through the
`RmiServiceExporter`. At the client we're linking it in using the `RmiProxyFactoryBean`.




[[remoting-caucho-protocols]]
=== Using Hessian or Burlap to remotely call services via HTTP
Hessian offers a binary HTTP-based remoting protocol. It is developed by Caucho and more
information about Hessian itself can be found at http://www.caucho.com[].



[[remoting-caucho-protocols-hessian]]
==== Wiring up the DispatcherServlet for Hessian and co.

Hessian communicates via HTTP and does so using a custom servlet. Using Spring's
`DispatcherServlet` principles, as known from Spring Web MVC usage, you can easily wire
up such a servlet exposing your services. First we'll have to create a new servlet in
your application (this is an excerpt from `'web.xml'`):

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>remoting</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
		<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>remoting</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/remoting/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
----

You're probably familiar with Spring's `DispatcherServlet` principles and if so, you
know that now you'll have to create a Spring container configuration resource named
`'remoting-servlet.xml'` (after the name of your servlet) in the `'WEB-INF'` directory.
The application context will be used in the next section.

Alternatively, consider the use of Spring's simpler `HttpRequestHandlerServlet`. This
allows you to embed the remote exporter definitions in your root application context (by
default in `'WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml'`), with individual servlet definitions
pointing to specific exporter beans. Each servlet name needs to match the bean name of
its target exporter in this case.



[[remoting-caucho-protocols-hessian-server]]
==== Exposing your beans by using the HessianServiceExporter

In the newly created application context called `remoting-servlet.xml`, we'll create a
`HessianServiceExporter` exporting your services:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="accountService" class="example.AccountServiceImpl">
		<!-- any additional properties, maybe a DAO? -->
	</bean>

	<bean name="/AccountService" class="org.springframework.remoting.caucho.HessianServiceExporter">
		<property name="service" ref="accountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----

Now we're ready to link in the service at the client. No explicit handler mapping is
specified, mapping request URLs onto services, so `BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping` will be
used: Hence, the service will be exported at the URL indicated through its bean name
within the containing `DispatcherServlet`'s mapping (as defined above):
`'http://HOST:8080/remoting/AccountService'`.

Alternatively, create a `HessianServiceExporter` in your root application context (e.g.
in `'WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml'`):

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean name="accountExporter" class="org.springframework.remoting.caucho.HessianServiceExporter">
		<property name="service" ref="accountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----

In the latter case, define a corresponding servlet for this exporter in `'web.xml'`,
with the same end result: The exporter getting mapped to the request path
`/remoting/AccountService`. Note that the servlet name needs to match the bean name of
the target exporter.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>accountExporter</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.context.support.HttpRequestHandlerServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>accountExporter</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/remoting/AccountService</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
----



[[remoting-caucho-protocols-hessian-client]]
==== Linking in the service on the client
Using the `HessianProxyFactoryBean` we can link in the service at the client. The same
principles apply as with the RMI example. We'll create a separate bean factory or
application context and mention the following beans where the `SimpleObject` is using
the `AccountService` to manage accounts:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="example.SimpleObject">
		<property name="accountService" ref="accountService"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="accountService" class="org.springframework.remoting.caucho.HessianProxyFactoryBean">
		<property name="serviceUrl" value="http://remotehost:8080/remoting/AccountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----



[[remoting-caucho-protocols-burlap]]
==== Using Burlap
We won't discuss Burlap, the XML-based equivalent of Hessian, in detail here, since it
is configured and set up in exactly the same way as the Hessian variant explained above.
Just replace the word `Hessian` with `Burlap` and you're all set to go.



[[remoting-caucho-protocols-security]]
==== Applying HTTP basic authentication to a service exposed through Hessian or Burlap
One of the advantages of Hessian and Burlap is that we can easily apply HTTP basic
authentication, because both protocols are HTTP-based. Your normal HTTP server security
mechanism can easily be applied through using the `web.xml` security features, for
example. Usually, you don't use per-user security credentials here, but rather shared
credentials defined at the `Hessian/BurlapProxyFactoryBean` level (similar to a JDBC
`DataSource`).

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping">
		<property name="interceptors" ref="authorizationInterceptor"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="authorizationInterceptor"
			class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.UserRoleAuthorizationInterceptor">
		<property name="authorizedRoles" value="administrator,operator"/>
	</bean>
----

This is an example where we explicitly mention the `BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping` and set
an interceptor allowing only administrators and operators to call the beans mentioned in
this application context.

[NOTE]
====
Of course, this example doesn't show a flexible kind of security infrastructure. For
more options as far as security is concerned, have a look at the Spring Security project
at http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[].
====




[[remoting-httpinvoker]]
=== Exposing services using HTTP invokers
As opposed to Burlap and Hessian, which are both lightweight protocols using their own
slim serialization mechanisms, Spring HTTP invokers use the standard Java serialization
mechanism to expose services through HTTP. This has a huge advantage if your arguments
and return types are complex types that cannot be serialized using the serialization
mechanisms Hessian and Burlap use (refer to the next section for more considerations
when choosing a remoting technology).

Under the hood, Spring uses either the standard facilities provided by the JDK or
Apache `HttpComponents` to perform HTTP calls. Use the latter if you need more
advanced and easier-to-use functionality. Refer to
http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/[hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/]
for more information.



[[remoting-httpinvoker-server]]
==== Exposing the service object
Setting up the HTTP invoker infrastructure for a service object resembles closely the
way you would do the same using Hessian or Burlap. Just as Hessian support provides the
`HessianServiceExporter`, Spring's HttpInvoker support provides the
`org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.HttpInvokerServiceExporter`.

To expose the `AccountService` (mentioned above) within a Spring Web MVC
`DispatcherServlet`, the following configuration needs to be in place in the
dispatcher's application context:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean name="/AccountService" class="org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.HttpInvokerServiceExporter">
		<property name="service" ref="accountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----

Such an exporter definition will be exposed through the `DispatcherServlet`'s standard
mapping facilities, as explained in the section on Hessian.

Alternatively, create an `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` in your root application context
(e.g. in `'WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml'`):

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean name="accountExporter" class="org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.HttpInvokerServiceExporter">
		<property name="service" ref="accountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----

In addition, define a corresponding servlet for this exporter in `'web.xml'`, with the
servlet name matching the bean name of the target exporter:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>accountExporter</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>org.springframework.web.context.support.HttpRequestHandlerServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>accountExporter</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/remoting/AccountService</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
----

If you are running outside of a servlet container and are using Oracle's Java 6, then you
can use the built-in HTTP server implementation. You can configure the
`SimpleHttpServerFactoryBean` together with a `SimpleHttpInvokerServiceExporter` as is
shown in this example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean name="accountExporter"
			class="org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.SimpleHttpInvokerServiceExporter">
		<property name="service" ref="accountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="httpServer"
			class="org.springframework.remoting.support.SimpleHttpServerFactoryBean">
		<property name="contexts">
			<util:map>
				<entry key="/remoting/AccountService" value-ref="accountExporter"/>
			</util:map>
		</property>
		<property name="port" value="8080" />
	</bean>
----



[[remoting-httpinvoker-client]]
==== Linking in the service at the client
Again, linking in the service from the client much resembles the way you would do it
when using Hessian or Burlap. Using a proxy, Spring will be able to translate your calls
to HTTP POST requests to the URL pointing to the exported service.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="httpInvokerProxy" class="org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.HttpInvokerProxyFactoryBean">
		<property name="serviceUrl" value="http://remotehost:8080/remoting/AccountService"/>
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
	</bean>
----

As mentioned before, you can choose what HTTP client you want to use. By default, the
`HttpInvokerProxy` uses the JDK's HTTP functionality, but you can also use the Apache
`HttpComponents` client by setting the `httpInvokerRequestExecutor` property:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<property name="httpInvokerRequestExecutor">
		<bean class="org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.HttpComponentsHttpInvokerRequestExecutor"/>
	</property>
----




[[remoting-web-services]]
=== Web services
Spring provides full support for standard Java web services APIs:

* Exposing web services using JAX-WS
* Accessing web services using JAX-WS

In addition to stock support for JAX-WS in Spring Core, the Spring portfolio also
features http://www.springframework.org/spring-ws[Spring Web Services], a solution for
contract-first, document-driven web services - highly recommended for building modern,
future-proof web services.



[[remoting-web-services-jaxws-export-servlet]]
==== Exposing servlet-based web services using JAX-WS
Spring provides a convenient base class for JAX-WS servlet endpoint implementations -
`SpringBeanAutowiringSupport`. To expose our `AccountService` we extend Spring's
`SpringBeanAutowiringSupport` class and implement our business logic here, usually
delegating the call to the business layer. We'll simply use Spring's `@Autowired`
annotation for expressing such dependencies on Spring-managed beans.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	/**
	 * JAX-WS compliant AccountService implementation that simply delegates
	 * to the AccountService implementation in the root web application context.
	 *
	 * This wrapper class is necessary because JAX-WS requires working with dedicated
	 * endpoint classes. If an existing service needs to be exported, a wrapper that
	 * extends SpringBeanAutowiringSupport for simple Spring bean autowiring (through
	 * the @Autowired annotation) is the simplest JAX-WS compliant way.
	 *
	 * This is the class registered with the server-side JAX-WS implementation.
	 * In the case of a Java EE 5 server, this would simply be defined as a servlet
	 * in web.xml, with the server detecting that this is a JAX-WS endpoint and reacting
	 * accordingly. The servlet name usually needs to match the specified WS service name.
	 *
	 * The web service engine manages the lifecycle of instances of this class.
	 * Spring bean references will just be wired in here.
	 */
	import org.springframework.web.context.support.SpringBeanAutowiringSupport;

	@WebService(serviceName="AccountService")
	public class AccountServiceEndpoint extends SpringBeanAutowiringSupport {

		@Autowired
		private AccountService biz;

		@WebMethod
		public void insertAccount(Account acc) {
			biz.insertAccount(acc);
		}

		@WebMethod
		public Account[] getAccounts(String name) {
			return biz.getAccounts(name);
		}

	}
----

Our `AccountServletEndpoint` needs to run in the same web application as the Spring
context to allow for access to Spring's facilities. This is the case by default in Java
EE 5 environments, using the standard contract for JAX-WS servlet endpoint deployment.
See Java EE 5 web service tutorials for details.



[[remoting-web-services-jaxws-export-standalone]]
==== Exporting standalone web services using JAX-WS
The built-in JAX-WS provider that comes with Oracle's JDK 1.6 supports exposure of web
services using the built-in HTTP server that's included in JDK 1.6 as well. Spring's
`SimpleJaxWsServiceExporter` detects all `@WebService` annotated beans in the Spring
application context, exporting them through the default JAX-WS server (the JDK 1.6 HTTP
server).

In this scenario, the endpoint instances are defined and managed as Spring beans
themselves; they will be registered with the JAX-WS engine but their lifecycle will be
up to the Spring application context. This means that Spring functionality like explicit
dependency injection may be applied to the endpoint instances. Of course,
annotation-driven injection through `@Autowired` will work as well.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="org.springframework.remoting.jaxws.SimpleJaxWsServiceExporter">
		<property name="baseAddress" value="http://localhost:8080/"/>
	</bean>

	<bean id="accountServiceEndpoint" class="example.AccountServiceEndpoint">
		...
	</bean>

	...
----

The `AccountServiceEndpoint` may derive from Spring's `SpringBeanAutowiringSupport` but
doesn't have to since the endpoint is a fully Spring-managed bean here. This means that
the endpoint implementation may look like as follows, without any superclass declared -
and Spring's `@Autowired` configuration annotation still being honored:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@WebService(serviceName="AccountService")
	public class AccountServiceEndpoint {

		@Autowired
		private AccountService biz;

		@WebMethod
		public void insertAccount(Account acc) {
			biz.insertAccount(acc);
		}

		@WebMethod
		public List<Account> getAccounts(String name) {
			return biz.getAccounts(name);
		}

	}
----



[[remoting-web-services-jaxws-export-ri]]
==== Exporting web services using the JAX-WS RI's Spring support
Oracle's JAX-WS RI, developed as part of the GlassFish project, ships Spring support as
part of its JAX-WS Commons project. This allows for defining JAX-WS endpoints as
Spring-managed beans, similar to the standalone mode discussed in the previous section -
but this time in a Servlet environment. __Note that this is not portable in a Java EE 5
environment; it is mainly intended for non-EE environments such as Tomcat, embedding the
JAX-WS RI as part of the web application.__

The difference to the standard style of exporting servlet-based endpoints is that the
lifecycle of the endpoint instances themselves will be managed by Spring here, and that
there will be only one JAX-WS servlet defined in `web.xml`. With the standard Java EE 5
style (as illustrated above), you'll have one servlet definition per service endpoint,
with each endpoint typically delegating to Spring beans (through the use of
`@Autowired`, as shown above).

Check out https://jax-ws-commons.java.net/spring/[https://jax-ws-commons.java.net/spring/]
for details on setup and usage style.



[[remoting-web-services-jaxws-access]]
==== Accessing web services using JAX-WS
Spring provides two factory beans to create JAX-WS web service proxies, namely
`LocalJaxWsServiceFactoryBean` and `JaxWsPortProxyFactoryBean`. The former can only
return a JAX-WS service class for us to work with. The latter is the full-fledged
version that can return a proxy that implements our business service interface. In this
example we use the latter to create a proxy for the `AccountService` endpoint (again):

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="accountWebService" class="org.springframework.remoting.jaxws.JaxWsPortProxyFactoryBean">
		<property name="serviceInterface" value="example.AccountService"/>
		<property name="wsdlDocumentUrl" value="http://localhost:8888/AccountServiceEndpoint?WSDL"/>
		<property name="namespaceUri" value="http://example/"/>
		<property name="serviceName" value="AccountService"/>
		<property name="portName" value="AccountServiceEndpointPort"/>
	</bean>
----

Where `serviceInterface` is our business interface the clients will use.
`wsdlDocumentUrl` is the URL for the WSDL file. Spring needs this a startup time to
create the JAX-WS Service. `namespaceUri` corresponds to the targetNamespace in the
.wsdl file. `serviceName` corresponds to the service name in the .wsdl file. `portName`
corresponds to the port name in the .wsdl file.

Accessing the web service is now very easy as we have a bean factory for it that will
expose it as `AccountService` interface. We can wire this up in Spring:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="client" class="example.AccountClientImpl">
		...
		<property name="service" ref="accountWebService"/>
	</bean>
----

From the client code we can access the web service just as if it was a normal class:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class AccountClientImpl {

		private AccountService service;

		public void setService(AccountService service) {
			this.service = service;
		}

		public void foo() {
			service.insertAccount(...);
		}
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
The above is slightly simplified in that JAX-WS requires endpoint interfaces
and implementation classes to be annotated with `@WebService`, `@SOAPBinding` etc
annotations. This means that you cannot (easily) use plain Java interfaces and
implementation classes as JAX-WS endpoint artifacts; you need to annotate them
accordingly first. Check the JAX-WS documentation for details on those requirements.
====




[[remoting-jms]]
=== JMS
It is also possible to expose services transparently using JMS as the underlying
communication protocol. The JMS remoting support in the Spring Framework is pretty basic
- it sends and receives on the `same thread` and in the __same non-transactional__
`Session`, and as such throughput will be very implementation dependent. Note that these
single-threaded and non-transactional constraints apply only to Spring's JMS
__remoting__ support. See <<jms>> for information on Spring's rich support for JMS-based
__messaging__.

The following interface is used on both the server and the client side.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	package com.foo;

	public interface CheckingAccountService {

		public void cancelAccount(Long accountId);

	}
----

The following simple implementation of the above interface is used on the server-side.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	package com.foo;

	public class SimpleCheckingAccountService implements CheckingAccountService {

		public void cancelAccount(Long accountId) {
			System.out.println("Cancelling account [" + accountId + "]");
		}

	}
----

This configuration file contains the JMS-infrastructure beans that are shared on both
the client and server.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

		</bean>

		<bean id="queue" class="org.apache.activemq.command.ActiveMQQueue">
			<constructor-arg value="mmm"/>
		</bean>

	</beans>
----



[[remoting-jms-server]]
==== Server-side configuration
On the server, you just need to expose the service object using the
`JmsInvokerServiceExporter`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----

The client merely needs to create a client-side proxy that will implement the agreed

[[remoting-autodection-remote-interfaces]]
=== Auto-detection is not implemented for remote interfaces
The main reason why auto-detection of implemented interfaces does not occur for remote
interfaces is to avoid opening too many doors to remote callers. The target object might
implement internal callback interfaces like `InitializingBean` or `DisposableBean` which
one would not want to expose to callers.

Offering a proxy with all interfaces implemented by the target usually does not matter
in the local case. But when exporting a remote service, you should expose a specific
service interface, with specific operations intended for remote usage. Besides internal
callback interfaces, the target might implement multiple business interfaces, with just
one of them intended for remote exposure. For these reasons, we __require__ such a
service interface to be specified.

This is a trade-off between configuration convenience and the risk of accidental
exposure of internal methods. Always specifying a service interface is not too much
effort, and puts you on the safe side regarding controlled exposure of specific methods.




[[remoting-considerations]]
=== Considerations when choosing a technology
Each and every technology presented here has its drawbacks. You should carefully
consider your needs, the services you are exposing and the objects you'll be sending
over the wire when choosing a technology.

When using RMI, it's not possible to access the objects through the HTTP protocol,
unless you're tunneling the RMI traffic. RMI is a fairly heavy-weight protocol in that
it supports full-object serialization which is important when using a complex data model
that needs serialization over the wire. However, RMI-JRMP is tied to Java clients: It is
a Java-to-Java remoting solution.

Spring's HTTP invoker is a good choice if you need HTTP-based remoting but also rely on
Java serialization. It shares the basic infrastructure with RMI invokers, just using
HTTP as transport. Note that HTTP invokers are not only limited to Java-to-Java remoting
but also to Spring on both the client and server side. (The latter also applies to
Spring's RMI invoker for non-RMI interfaces.)

Hessian and/or Burlap might provide significant value when operating in a heterogeneous
environment, because they explicitly allow for non-Java clients. However, non-Java
support is still limited. Known issues include the serialization of Hibernate objects in
combination with lazily-initialized collections. If you have such a data model, consider
using RMI or HTTP invokers instead of Hessian.

JMS can be useful for providing clusters of services and allowing the JMS broker to take
care of load balancing, discovery and auto-failover. By default: Java serialization is
used when using JMS remoting but the JMS provider could use a different mechanism for
the wire formatting, such as XStream to allow servers to be implemented in other
technologies.

Last but not least, EJB has an advantage over RMI in that it supports standard
role-based authentication and authorization and remote transaction propagation. It is
possible to get RMI invokers or HTTP invokers to support security context propagation as
well, although this is not provided by core Spring: There are just appropriate hooks for
plugging in third-party or custom solutions here.




[[rest-client-access]]
=== Accessing RESTful services on the Client
The `RestTemplate` is the core class for client-side access to RESTful services. It is
conceptually similar to other template classes in Spring, such as `JdbcTemplate` and
`JmsTemplate` and other template classes found in other Spring portfolio projects.
`RestTemplate`'s behavior is customized by providing callback methods and configuring
the `HttpMessageConverter` used to marshal objects into the HTTP request body and to
unmarshal any response back into an object. As it is common to use XML as a message
format, Spring provides a `MarshallingHttpMessageConverter` that uses the Object-to-XML
framework that is part of the `org.springframework.oxm` package. This gives you a wide
range of choices of XML to Object mapping technologies to choose from.

This section describes how to use the `RestTemplate` and its associated
`HttpMessageConverters`.



[[rest-resttemplate]]
==== RestTemplate
Invoking RESTful services in Java is typically done using a helper class such as Apache
HttpComponents `HttpClient`. For common REST operations this approach is too low level as
shown below.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	String uri = "http://example.com/hotels/1/bookings";

	PostMethod post = new PostMethod(uri);
	String request = // create booking request content
	post.setRequestEntity(new StringRequestEntity(request));

	httpClient.executeMethod(post);

	if (HttpStatus.SC_CREATED == post.getStatusCode()) {
		Header location = post.getRequestHeader("Location");
		if (location != null) {
			System.out.println("Created new booking at :" + location.getValue());
		}
	}
----

RestTemplate provides higher level methods that correspond to each of the six main HTTP
methods that make invoking many RESTful services a one-liner and enforce REST best
practices.


[NOTE]
====
RestTemplate has an asynchronous counter-part: see <<rest-async-resttemplate>>.

|===

The names of `RestTemplate` methods follow a naming convention, the first part indicates
what HTTP method is being invoked and the second part indicates what is returned. For
example, the method `getForObject()` will perform a GET, convert the HTTP response into
an object type of your choice and return that object. The method `postForLocation()`
will do a POST, converting the given object into a HTTP request and return the response
HTTP Location header where the newly created object can be found. In case of an
exception processing the HTTP request, an exception of the type `RestClientException`
will be thrown; this behavior can be changed by plugging in another
`ResponseErrorHandler` implementation into the `RestTemplate`.

The `exchange` and `execute` methods are generalized versions of the more
specific methods listed above them and can support additional combinations and methods,
like HTTP PATCH. However, note that the underlying HTTP library must also support the
desired combination. The JDK `HttpURLConnection` does not support the `PATCH` method, but
Apache HttpComponents HttpClient version 4.2 or later does. They also enable
`RestTemplate` to read an HTTP response to a generic type (e.g. `List<Account>`), using a
`ParameterizedTypeReference`, a new class that enables capturing and passing generic
type info.

Objects passed to and returned from these methods are converted to and from HTTP
messages by `HttpMessageConverter` instances. Converters for the main mime types are
registered by default, but you can also write your own converter and register it via the
`messageConverters()` bean property. The default converter instances registered with the
template are `ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter`, `StringHttpMessageConverter`,
`FormHttpMessageConverter` and `SourceHttpMessageConverter`. You can override these
defaults using the `messageConverters()` bean property as would be required if using the
`MarshallingHttpMessageConverter` or `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`.

Each method takes URI template arguments in two forms, either as a `String` variable
length argument or a `Map<String,String>`. For example,

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	String result = restTemplate.getForObject(
			"http://example.com/hotels/{hotel}/bookings/{booking}", String.class,"42", "21");
----

using variable length arguments and

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Map<String, String> vars = Collections.singletonMap("hotel", "42");
	String result = restTemplate.getForObject(
			"http://example.com/hotels/{hotel}/rooms/{hotel}", String.class, vars);
----

using a `Map<String,String>`.

To create an instance of `RestTemplate` you can simply call the default no-arg
constructor. This will use standard Java classes from the `java.net` package as the
underlying implementation to create HTTP requests. This can be overridden by specifying
an implementation of `ClientHttpRequestFactory`. Spring provides the implementation
`HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` that uses the Apache HttpComponents
`HttpClient` to create requests. `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` is configured
using an instance of `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient` which can in turn be configured
with credentials information or connection pooling functionality.

[TIP]
====
Note that the `java.net` implementation for HTTP requests may raise an exception when
accessing the status of a response that represents an error (e.g. 401). If this is an
issue, switch to `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` instead.
====
The previous example using Apache HttpComponents `HttpClient` directly rewritten to use
the `RestTemplate` is shown below

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	uri = "http://example.com/hotels/{id}/bookings";

	RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate();

	Booking booking = // create booking object

	URI location = template.postForLocation(uri, booking, "1");
----

To use Apache HttpComponents instead of the native `java.net` functionality, construct
the `RestTemplate` as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate(new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory());
----

[TIP]
====
Apache HttpClient supports gzip encoding. To use it,
construct a `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` like so:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	HttpClient httpClient = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();
    ClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory(httpClient);
    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(requestFactory);
----
====
The general callback interface is `RequestCallback` and is called when the execute
method is invoked.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public <T> T execute(String url, HttpMethod method, RequestCallback requestCallback,
			ResponseExtractor<T> responseExtractor, String... urlVariables)

	// also has an overload with urlVariables as a Map<String, String>.
----

The `RequestCallback` interface is defined as

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface RequestCallback {
	 void doWithRequest(ClientHttpRequest request) throws IOException;
	}
----

and allows you to manipulate the request headers and write to the request body. When
using the execute method you do not have to worry about any resource management, the
template will always close the request and handle any errors. Refer to the API
documentation for more information on using the execute method and the meaning of its
other method arguments.


[[rest-resttemplate-uri]]
===== Working with the URI
For each of the main HTTP methods, the `RestTemplate` provides variants that either take
a String URI or `java.net.URI` as the first argument.

The String URI variants accept template arguments as a String variable length argument
or as a `Map<String,String>`. They also assume the URL String is not encoded and needs
to be encoded. For example the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	restTemplate.getForObject("http://example.com/hotel list", String.class);
----

will perform a GET on `http://example.com/hotel%20list`. That means if the input URL
String is already encoded, it will be encoded twice -- i.e.
`http://example.com/hotel%20list` will become `http://example.com/hotel%2520list`. If
this is not the intended effect, use the `java.net.URI` method variant, which assumes
the URL is already encoded is also generally useful if you want to reuse a single (fully
expanded) `URI` multiple times.

The `UriComponentsBuilder` class can be used to build and encode the `URI` including
support for URI templates. For example you can start with a URL String:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	UriComponents uriComponents = UriComponentsBuilder.fromUriString(
			"http://example.com/hotels/{hotel}/bookings/{booking}").build()
			.expand("42", "21")
			.encode();

	URI uri = uriComponents.toUri();
----

Or specify each URI component individually:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	UriComponents uriComponents = UriComponentsBuilder.newInstance()
			.scheme("http").host("example.com").path("/hotels/{hotel}/bookings/{booking}").build()
			.expand("42", "21")
			.encode();

	URI uri = uriComponents.toUri();
----


[[rest-template-headers]]
===== Dealing with request and response headers
Besides the methods described above, the `RestTemplate` also has the `exchange()`
method, which can be used for arbitrary HTTP method execution based on the `HttpEntity`
class.

Perhaps most importantly, the `exchange()` method can be used to add request headers and
read response headers. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	HttpHeaders requestHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
	requestHeaders.set("MyRequestHeader", "MyValue");
	HttpEntity<?> requestEntity = new HttpEntity(requestHeaders);

	HttpEntity<String> response = template.exchange(
			"http://example.com/hotels/{hotel}",
			HttpMethod.GET, requestEntity, String.class, "42");

	String responseHeader = response.getHeaders().getFirst("MyResponseHeader");
	String body = response.getBody();
----

In the above example, we first prepare a request entity that contains the
`MyRequestHeader` header. We then retrieve the response, and read the `MyResponseHeader`
and body.

[[rest-template-jsonview]]
===== Jackson JSON Views support

It is possible to specify a http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonJsonViews[Jackson JSON View]
to serialize only a subset of the object properties. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	JacksonSerializationValue jsv = new JacksonSerializationValue(new User("eric", "7!jd#h23"),
		User.WithoutPasswordView.class);
	HttpEntity<JacksonSerializationValue> entity = new HttpEntity<JacksonSerializationValue>(jsv);
	String s = template.postForObject("http://example.com/user", entity, String.class);
----


[[rest-message-conversion]]
==== HTTP Message Conversion
Objects passed to and returned from the methods `getForObject()`, `postForLocation()`,
and `put()` are converted to HTTP requests and from HTTP responses by
`HttpMessageConverters`. The `HttpMessageConverter` interface is shown below to give you
a better feel for its functionality

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface HttpMessageConverter<T> {

		// Indicate whether the given class and media type can be read by this converter.
		boolean canRead(Class<?> clazz, MediaType mediaType);

		// Indicate whether the given class and media type can be written by this converter.
		boolean canWrite(Class<?> clazz, MediaType mediaType);

		// Return the list of MediaType objects supported by this converter.
		List<MediaType> getSupportedMediaTypes();

		// Read an object of the given type from the given input message, and returns it.
		T read(Class<T> clazz, HttpInputMessage inputMessage) throws IOException, HttpMessageNotReadableException;

		// Write an given object to the given output message.
		void write(T t, HttpOutputMessage outputMessage) throws IOException, HttpMessageNotWritableException;

	}
----

Concrete implementations for the main media (mime) types are provided in the framework
and are registered by default with the `RestTemplate` on the client-side and with
`AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter` on the server-side.

The implementations of ++HttpMessageConverter++s are described in the following sections.
For all converters a default media type is used but can be overridden by setting the
`supportedMediaTypes` bean property


[[rest-string-converter]]
===== StringHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write Strings from the HTTP
request and response. By default, this converter supports all text media types (
`text/*`), and writes with a `Content-Type` of `text/plain`.


[[rest-form-converter]]
===== FormHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write form data from the HTTP
request and response. By default, this converter reads and writes the media type
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Form data is read from and written into a
`MultiValueMap<String, String>`.


[[rest-byte-converter]]
===== ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write byte arrays from the
HTTP request and response. By default, this converter supports all media types ( `*/*`),
and writes with a `Content-Type` of `application/octet-stream`. This can be overridden
by setting the `supportedMediaTypes` property, and overriding `getContentType(byte[])`.


[[rest-marhsalling-converter]]
===== MarshallingHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write XML using Spring's
`Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` abstractions from the `org.springframework.oxm` package.
This converter requires a `Marshaller` and `Unmarshaller` before it can be used. These
can be injected via constructor or bean properties. By default this converter supports (
`text/xml`) and ( `application/xml`).


[[rest-mapping-json-converter]]
===== MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write JSON using Jackson's
`ObjectMapper`. JSON mapping can be customized as needed through the use of Jackson's
provided annotations. When further control is needed, a custom `ObjectMapper` can be
injected through the `ObjectMapper` property for cases where custom JSON
serializers/deserializers need to be provided for specific types. By default this
converter supports ( `application/json`).


[[rest-mapping-xml-converter]]
===== MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write XML using
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml[Jackson XML] extension's
`XmlMapper`. XML mapping can be customized as needed through the use of JAXB
or Jackson's provided annotations. When further control is needed, a custom `XmlMapper`
can be injected through the `ObjectMapper` property for cases where custom XML
serializers/deserializers need to be provided for specific types. By default this
converter supports ( `application/xml`).


[[rest-source-converter]]
===== SourceHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write
`javax.xml.transform.Source` from the HTTP request and response. Only `DOMSource`,
`SAXSource`, and `StreamSource` are supported. By default, this converter supports (
`text/xml`) and ( `application/xml`).


[[rest-buffered-image-converter]]
===== BufferedImageHttpMessageConverter
An `HttpMessageConverter` implementation that can read and write
`java.awt.image.BufferedImage` from the HTTP request and response. This converter reads
and writes the media type supported by the Java I/O API.

[[rest-async-resttemplate]]
==== Async RestTemplate

Web applications often need to query external REST services those days. The very nature of
HTTP and synchronous calls can lead up to challenges when scaling applications for those
needs: multiple threads may be blocked, waiting for remote HTTP responses.

`AsyncRestTemplate` and <<rest-resttemplate>>'s APIs are very similar; see
<<rest-overview-of-resttemplate-methods-tbl>>. The main difference between those APIs is
that `AsyncRestTemplate` returns
{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/util/concurrent/ListenableFuture.html[`ListenableFuture`]
wrappers as opposed to concrete results.

The previous `RestTemplate` example translates to:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// async call
	Future<ResponseEntity<String>> futureEntity = template.getForEntity(
		"http://example.com/hotels/{hotel}/bookings/{booking}", String.class, "42", "21");

	// get the concrete result - synchronous call
	ResponseEntity<String> entity = futureEntity.get();
----

{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/util/concurrent/ListenableFuture.html[`ListenableFuture`]
accepts completion callbacks:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ListenableFuture<ResponseEntity<String>> futureEntity = template.getForEntity(
		"http://example.com/hotels/{hotel}/bookings/{booking}", String.class, "42", "21");

	// register a callback
	futureEntity.addCallback(new ListenableFutureCallback<ResponseEntity<String>>() {
		@Override
		public void onSuccess(ResponseEntity<String> entity) {
			//...
		}

		@Override
		public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
			//...
		}
	});
----

[NOTE]
====
The default `AsyncRestTemplate` constructor registers a
{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/core/task/SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.html[`SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor`
] for executing HTTP requests.
When dealing with a large number of short-lived requests, a thread-pooling TaskExecutor
implementation like
{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.html[`ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`]
may be a good choice.
====

{javadoc-baseurl}/org/springframework/util/concurrent/ListenableFuture.html[`ListenableFuture` javadocs]
and
