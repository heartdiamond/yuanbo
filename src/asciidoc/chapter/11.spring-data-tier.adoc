== Transaction Management




[[transaction-intro]]
=== Introduction to Spring Framework transaction management
Comprehensive transaction support is among the most compelling reasons to use the Spring
Framework. The Spring Framework provides a consistent abstraction for transaction
management that delivers the following benefits:

* Consistent programming model across different transaction APIs such as Java
  Transaction API (JTA), JDBC, Hibernate, Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Data
  Objects (JDO).
* Support for <<transaction-declarative,declarative transaction management>>.
* Simpler API for <<transaction-programmatic,programmatic>> transaction management than
  complex transaction APIs such as JTA.
* Excellent integration with Spring's data access abstractions.

The following sections describe the Spring Framework's transaction value-adds and
technologies. (The chapter also includes discussions of best practices, application
server integration, and solutions to common problems.)

* <<transaction-motivation,Advantages of the Spring Framework's transaction support
  model>> describes __why__ you would use the Spring Framework's transaction abstraction
  instead of EJB Container-Managed Transactions (CMT) or choosing to drive local
  transactions through a proprietary API such as Hibernate.
* <<transaction-strategies,Understanding the Spring Framework transaction abstraction>>
  outlines the core classes and describes how to configure and obtain `DataSource`
  instances from a variety of sources.
* <<tx-resource-synchronization,Synchronizing resources with transactions >>describes
  how the application code ensures that resources are created, reused, and cleaned up
  properly.
* <<transaction-declarative,Declarative transaction management>> describes support for
  declarative transaction management.
* <<transaction-programmatic,Programmatic transaction management>> covers support for
  programmatic (that is, explicitly coded) transaction management.




[[transaction-motivation]]
=== Advantages of the Spring Framework's transaction support model
Traditionally, Java EE developers have had two choices for transaction management:
__global__ or __local__ transactions, both of which have profound limitations. Global
and local transaction management is reviewed in the next two sections, followed by a
discussion of how the Spring Framework's transaction management support addresses the
limitations of the global and local transaction models.



[[transaction-global]]
==== Global transactions
Global transactions enable you to work with multiple transactional resources, typically
relational databases and message queues. The application server manages global
transactions through the JTA, which is a cumbersome API to use (partly due to its
exception model). Furthermore, a JTA `UserTransaction` normally needs to be sourced from
JNDI, meaning that you __also__ need to use JNDI in order to use JTA. Obviously the use
of global transactions would limit any potential reuse of application code, as JTA is
normally only available in an application server environment.

Previously, the preferred way to use global transactions was via EJB __CMT__
(__Container Managed Transaction__): CMT is a form of __declarative transaction
management__ (as distinguished from __programmatic transaction management__). EJB CMT
removes the need for transaction-related JNDI lookups, although of course the use of EJB
itself necessitates the use of JNDI. It removes most but not all of the need to write
Java code to control transactions. The significant downside is that CMT is tied to JTA
and an application server environment. Also, it is only available if one chooses to
implement business logic in EJBs, or at least behind a transactional EJB facade. The
negatives of EJB in general are so great that this is not an attractive proposition,
especially in the face of compelling alternatives for declarative transaction management.



[[transaction-local]]
==== Local transactions
Local transactions are resource-specific, such as a transaction associated with a JDBC
connection. Local transactions may be easier to use, but have significant disadvantages:
they cannot work across multiple transactional resources. For example, code that manages
transactions using a JDBC connection cannot run within a global JTA transaction. Because
the application server is not involved in transaction management, it cannot help ensure
correctness across multiple resources. (It is worth noting that most applications use a
single transaction resource.) Another downside is that local transactions are invasive
to the programming model.



[[transaction-programming-model]]
==== Spring Framework's consistent programming model

Spring resolves the disadvantages of global and local transactions. It enables
application developers to use a __consistent__ programming model __in any environment__.
You write your code once, and it can benefit from different transaction management
strategies in different environments. The Spring Framework provides both declarative and
programmatic transaction management. Most users prefer declarative transaction
management, which is recommended in most cases.

With programmatic transaction management, developers work with the Spring Framework
transaction abstraction, which can run over any underlying transaction infrastructure.
With the preferred declarative model, developers typically write little or no code
related to transaction management, and hence do not depend on the Spring Framework
transaction API, or any other transaction API.

.Do you need an application server for transaction management?
****
The Spring Framework's transaction management support changes traditional rules as to
when an enterprise Java application requires an application server.

In particular, you do not need an application server simply for declarative transactions
through EJBs. In fact, even if your application server has powerful JTA capabilities,
you may decide that the Spring Framework's declarative transactions offer more power and
a more productive programming model than EJB CMT.

Typically you need an application server's JTA capability only if your application needs
to handle transactions across multiple resources, which is not a requirement for many
applications. Many high-end applications use a single, highly scalable database (such as
Oracle RAC) instead. Standalone transaction managers such as
http://www.atomikos.com/[Atomikos Transactions] and http://jotm.objectweb.org/[JOTM]
are other options. Of course, you may need other application server capabilities such as
Java Message Service (JMS) and Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA).

The Spring Framework __gives you the choice of when to scale your application to a fully
loaded application server__. Gone are the days when the only alternative to using EJB
CMT or JTA was to write code with local transactions such as those on JDBC connections,
and face a hefty rework if you need that code to run within global, container-managed
transactions. With the Spring Framework, only some of the bean definitions in your
configuration file, rather than your code, need to change.
****




[[transaction-strategies]]
=== Understanding the Spring Framework transaction abstraction
The key to the Spring transaction abstraction is the notion of a __transaction
strategy__. A transaction strategy is defined by the
`org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager` interface:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface PlatformTransactionManager {

		TransactionStatus getTransaction(
				TransactionDefinition definition) throws TransactionException;

		void commit(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;

		void rollback(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;
	}
----

This is primarily a service provider interface (SPI), although it can be used
<<transaction-programmatic-ptm,programmatically>> from your application code. Because
`PlatformTransactionManager` is an __interface__, it can be easily mocked or stubbed as
necessary. It is not tied to a lookup strategy such as JNDI.
`PlatformTransactionManager` implementations are defined like any other object (or bean)
in the Spring Framework IoC container. This benefit alone makes Spring Framework
transactions a worthwhile abstraction even when you work with JTA. Transactional code
can be tested much more easily than if it used JTA directly.

Again in keeping with Spring's philosophy, the `TransactionException` that can be thrown
by any of the `PlatformTransactionManager` interface's methods is __unchecked__ (that
is, it extends the `java.lang.RuntimeException` class). Transaction infrastructure
failures are almost invariably fatal. In rare cases where application code can actually
recover from a transaction failure, the application developer can still choose to catch
and handle `TransactionException`. The salient point is that developers are not
__forced__ to do so.

The `getTransaction(..)` method returns a `TransactionStatus` object, depending on a
`TransactionDefinition` parameter. The returned `TransactionStatus` might represent a
new transaction, or can represent an existing transaction if a matching transaction
exists in the current call stack. The implication in this latter case is that, as with
Java EE transaction contexts, a `TransactionStatus` is associated with a __thread__ of
execution.

The `TransactionDefinition` interface specifies:

* __Isolation__: The degree to which this transaction is isolated from the work of other
  transactions. For example, can this transaction see uncommitted writes from other
  transactions?
* __Propagation__: Typically, all code executed within a transaction scope will run in
  that transaction. However, you have the option of specifying the behavior in the event
  that a transactional method is executed when a transaction context already exists. For
  example, code can continue running in the existing transaction (the common case); or
  the existing transaction can be suspended and a new transaction created. __Spring
  offers all of the transaction propagation options familiar from EJB CMT__. To read
  about the semantics of transaction propagation in Spring, see <<tx-propagation>>.
* __Timeout__: How long this transaction runs before timing out and being rolled back
  automatically by the underlying transaction infrastructure.
* __Read-only status__: A read-only transaction can be used when your code reads but
  does not modify data. Read-only transactions can be a useful optimization in some
  cases, such as when you are using Hibernate.

These settings reflect standard transactional concepts. If necessary, refer to resources
that discuss transaction isolation levels and other core transaction concepts.
Understanding these concepts is essential to using the Spring Framework or any
transaction management solution.

The `TransactionStatus` interface provides a simple way for transactional code to
control transaction execution and query transaction status. The concepts should be
familiar, as they are common to all transaction APIs:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public interface TransactionStatus extends SavepointManager {

		boolean isNewTransaction();

		boolean hasSavepoint();

		void setRollbackOnly();

		boolean isRollbackOnly();

		void flush();

		boolean isCompleted();

	}
----

Regardless of whether you opt for declarative or programmatic transaction management in
Spring, defining the correct `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation is absolutely
essential. You typically define this implementation through dependency injection.

`PlatformTransactionManager` implementations normally require knowledge of the
environment in which they work: JDBC, JTA, Hibernate, and so on. The following examples
show how you can define a local `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation. (This
example works with plain JDBC.)

You define a JDBC `DataSource`

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
		<property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driverClassName}" />
		<property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}" />
		<property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}" />
		<property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}" />
	</bean>
----

The related `PlatformTransactionManager` bean definition will then have a reference to
the `DataSource` definition. It will look like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
		<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
	</bean>
----

If you use JTA in a Java EE container then you use a container `DataSource`, obtained
through JNDI, in conjunction with Spring's `JtaTransactionManager`. This is what the JTA
and JNDI lookup version would look like:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:jee="http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee"
		xsi:schemaLocation="
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/jee/spring-jee.xsd">

		<jee:jndi-lookup id="dataSource" jndi-name="jdbc/jpetstore"/>

		<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager" />

		<!-- other <bean/> definitions here -->

	</beans>
----

The `JtaTransactionManager` does not need to know about the `DataSource`, or any other
specific resources, because it uses the container's global transaction management
infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
The above definition of the `dataSource` bean uses the `<jndi-lookup/>` tag from the
`jee` namespace. For more information on schema-based configuration, see <<xsd-config>>,
and for more information on the `<jee/>` tags see the section entitled
<<xsd-config-body-schemas-jee>>.
====

You can also use Hibernate local transactions easily, as shown in the following
examples. In this case, you need to define a Hibernate `LocalSessionFactoryBean`, which
your application code will use to obtain Hibernate `Session` instances.

The `DataSource` bean definition will be similar to the local JDBC example shown
previously and thus is not shown in the following example.

[NOTE]
====
If the `DataSource`, used by any non-JTA transaction manager, is looked up via JNDI and
managed by a Java EE container, then it should be non-transactional because the Spring
Framework, rather than the Java EE container, will manage the transactions.
====

The `txManager` bean in this case is of the `HibernateTransactionManager` type. In the
same way as the `DataSourceTransactionManager` needs a reference to the `DataSource`,
the `HibernateTransactionManager` needs a reference to the `SessionFactory`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="sessionFactory" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean">
		<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource" />
		<property name="mappingResources">
			<list>
				<value>org/springframework/samples/petclinic/hibernate/petclinic.hbm.xml</value>
			</list>
		</property>
		<property name="hibernateProperties">
			<value>
				hibernate.dialect=${hibernate.dialect}
			</value>
		</property>
	</bean>

	<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager">
		<property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory" />
	</bean>
----

If you are using Hibernate and Java EE container-managed JTA transactions, then you
should simply use the same `JtaTransactionManager` as in the previous JTA example for
JDBC.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"/>
----

[NOTE]
====
If you use JTA , then your transaction manager definition will look the same regardless
of what data access technology you use, be it JDBC, Hibernate JPA or any other supported
technology. This is due to the fact that JTA transactions are global transactions, which
can enlist any transactional resource.
====

In all these cases, application code does not need to change. You can change how
transactions are managed merely by changing configuration, even if that change means
moving from local to global transactions or vice versa.




[[tx-resource-synchronization]]
=== Synchronizing resources with transactions
It should now be clear how you create different transaction managers, and how they are
linked to related resources that need to be synchronized to transactions (for example
`DataSourceTransactionManager` to a JDBC `DataSource`, `HibernateTransactionManager` to
a Hibernate `SessionFactory`, and so forth). This section describes how the application
code, directly or indirectly using a persistence API such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO,
ensures that these resources are created, reused, and cleaned up properly. The section
also discusses how transaction synchronization is triggered (optionally) through the
relevant `PlatformTransactionManager`.



[[tx-resource-synchronization-high]]
==== High-level synchronization approach
The preferred approach is to use Spring's highest level template based persistence
integration APIs or to use native ORM APIs with transaction- aware factory beans or
proxies for managing the native resource factories. These transaction-aware solutions
internally handle resource creation and reuse, cleanup, optional transaction
synchronization of the resources, and exception mapping. Thus user data access code does
not have to address these tasks, but can be focused purely on non-boilerplate
persistence logic. Generally, you use the native ORM API or take a __template__ approach
for JDBC access by using the `JdbcTemplate`. These solutions are detailed in subsequent
chapters of this reference documentation.



[[tx-resource-synchronization-low]]
==== Low-level synchronization approach
Classes such as `DataSourceUtils` (for JDBC), `EntityManagerFactoryUtils` (for JPA),
`SessionFactoryUtils` (for Hibernate), `PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils` (for JDO), and
so on exist at a lower level. When you want the application code to deal directly with
the resource types of the native persistence APIs, you use these classes to ensure that
proper Spring Framework-managed instances are obtained, transactions are (optionally)
synchronized, and exceptions that occur in the process are properly mapped to a
consistent API.

For example, in the case of JDBC, instead of the traditional JDBC approach of calling
the `getConnection()` method on the `DataSource`, you instead use Spring's
`org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceUtils` class as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Connection conn = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(dataSource);
----

If an existing transaction already has a connection synchronized (linked) to it, that
instance is returned. Otherwise, the method call triggers the creation of a new
connection, which is (optionally) synchronized to any existing transaction, and made
available for subsequent reuse in that same transaction. As mentioned, any
`SQLException` is wrapped in a Spring Framework `CannotGetJdbcConnectionException`, one
of the Spring Framework's hierarchy of unchecked DataAccessExceptions. This approach
gives you more information than can be obtained easily from the `SQLException`, and
ensures portability across databases, even across different persistence technologies.

This approach also works without Spring transaction management (transaction
synchronization is optional), so you can use it whether or not you are using Spring for
transaction management.

Of course, once you have used Spring's JDBC support, JPA support or Hibernate support,
you will generally prefer not to use `DataSourceUtils` or the other helper classes,
because you will be much happier working through the Spring abstraction than directly
with the relevant APIs. For example, if you use the Spring `JdbcTemplate` or
`jdbc.object` package to simplify your use of JDBC, correct connection retrieval occurs
behind the scenes and you won't need to write any special code.



[[tx-resource-synchronization-tadsp]]
==== TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy

At the very lowest level exists the `TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy` class. This is a
proxy for a target `DataSource`, which wraps the target `DataSource` to add awareness of
Spring-managed transactions. In this respect, it is similar to a transactional JNDI
`DataSource` as provided by a Java EE server.

It should almost never be necessary or desirable to use this class, except when existing
code must be called and passed a standard JDBC `DataSource` interface implementation. In
that case, it is possible that this code is usable, but participating in Spring managed
transactions. It is preferable to write your new code by using the higher level
abstractions mentioned above.




[[transaction-declarative]]
=== Declarative transaction management
[NOTE]
====
Most Spring Framework users choose declarative transaction management. This option has
the least impact on application code, and hence is most consistent with the ideals of a
__non-invasive__ lightweight container.
====

The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is made possible with Spring
aspect-oriented programming (AOP), although, as the transactional aspects code comes
with the Spring Framework distribution and may be used in a boilerplate fashion, AOP
concepts do not generally have to be understood to make effective use of this code.

The Spring Framework's declarative transaction management is similar to EJB CMT in that
you can specify transaction behavior (or lack of it) down to individual method level. It
is possible to make a `setRollbackOnly()` call within a transaction context if
necessary. The differences between the two types of transaction management are:

* Unlike EJB CMT, which is tied to JTA, the Spring Framework's declarative transaction
  management works in any environment. It can work with JTA transactions or local
  transactions using JDBC, JPA, Hibernate or JDO by simply adjusting the configuration
  files.
* You can apply the Spring Framework declarative transaction management to any class,
  not merely special classes such as EJBs.
* The Spring Framework offers declarative
  <<transaction-declarative-rolling-back,__rollback rules__, >>a feature with no EJB
  equivalent. Both programmatic and declarative support for rollback rules is provided.
* The Spring Framework enables you to customize transactional behavior, by using AOP.
  For example, you can insert custom behavior in the case of transaction rollback. You
  can also add arbitrary advice, along with the transactional advice. With EJB CMT, you
  cannot influence the container's transaction management except with
  `setRollbackOnly()`.
* The Spring Framework does not support propagation of transaction contexts across
  remote calls, as do high-end application servers. If you need this feature, we
  recommend that you use EJB. However, consider carefully before using such a feature,
  because normally, one does not want transactions to span remote calls.

.Where is TransactionProxyFactoryBean?
****
Declarative transaction configuration in versions of Spring 2.0 and above differs
considerably from previous versions of Spring. The main difference is that there is no
longer any need to configure `TransactionProxyFactoryBean` beans.

The pre-Spring 2.0 configuration style is still 100% valid configuration; think of the
new `<tx:tags/>` as simply defining `TransactionProxyFactoryBean` beans on your behalf.
****

The concept of rollback rules is important: they enable you to specify which exceptions
(and throwables) should cause automatic rollback. You specify this declaratively, in
configuration, not in Java code. So, although you can still call `setRollbackOnly()` on
the `TransactionStatus` object to roll back the current transaction back, most often you
can specify a rule that `MyApplicationException` must always result in rollback. The
significant advantage to this option is that business objects do not depend on the
transaction infrastructure. For example, they typically do not need to import Spring
transaction APIs or other Spring APIs.

Although EJB container default behavior automatically rolls back the transaction on a
__system exception__ (usually a runtime exception), EJB CMT does not roll back the
transaction automatically on an__application exception__ (that is, a checked exception
other than `java.rmi.RemoteException`). While the Spring default behavior for
declarative transaction management follows EJB convention (roll back is automatic only
on unchecked exceptions), it is often useful to customize this behavior.



[[tx-decl-explained]]
==== Understanding the Spring Framework's declarative transaction implementation
It is not sufficient to tell you simply to annotate your classes with the
`@Transactional` annotation, add `@EnableTransactionManagement` to your configuration,
and then expect you to understand how it all works. This section explains the inner
workings of the Spring Framework's declarative transaction infrastructure in the event
of transaction-related issues.

The most important concepts to grasp with regard to the Spring Framework's declarative
transaction support are that this support is enabled
<<aop-understanding-aop-proxies,__via AOP proxies__>>, and that the transactional advice
is driven by __metadata__ (currently XML- or annotation-based). The combination of AOP
with transactional metadata yields an AOP proxy that uses a `TransactionInterceptor` in
conjunction with an appropriate `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation to drive
transactions __around method invocations__.

[NOTE]
====
Spring AOP is covered in <<aop>>.
====

Conceptually, calling a method on a transactional proxy looks like this...

image::images/tx.png[width=400]



[[transaction-declarative-first-example]]
==== Example of declarative transaction implementation
Consider the following interface, and its attendant implementation. This example uses
`Foo` and `Bar` classes as placeholders so that you can concentrate on the transaction
usage without focusing on a particular domain model. For the purposes of this example,
the fact that the `DefaultFooService` class throws `UnsupportedOperationException`
instances in the body of each implemented method is good; it allows you to see
transactions created and then rolled back in response to the
`UnsupportedOperationException` instance.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// the service interface that we want to make transactional

	package x.y.service;

	public interface FooService {

		Foo getFoo(String fooName);

		Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName);

		void insertFoo(Foo foo);

		void updateFoo(Foo foo);

	}
----

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// an implementation of the above interface

	package x.y.service;

	public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

		public Foo getFoo(String fooName) {
			throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
		}

		public Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName) {
			throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
		}

		public void insertFoo(Foo foo) {
			throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
		}

		public void updateFoo(Foo foo) {
			throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
		}

	}
----

Assume that the first two methods of the `FooService` interface, `getFoo(String)` and
`getFoo(String, String)`, must execute in the context of a transaction with read-only
semantics, and that the other methods, `insertFoo(Foo)` and `updateFoo(Foo)`, must
execute in the context of a transaction with read-write semantics. The following
configuration is explained in detail in the next few paragraphs.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]

		<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
			<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
		</bean>

		<!-- other <bean/> definitions here -->

	</beans>
----

Examine the preceding configuration. You want to make a service object, the `fooService`
bean, transactional. The transaction semantics to apply are encapsulated in the
`<tx:advice/>` definition. The `<tx:advice/>` definition reads as "__... all methods on
starting with `'get'` are to execute in the context of a read-only transaction, and all
other methods are to execute with the default transaction semantics__". The
`transaction-manager` attribute of the `<tx:advice/>` tag is set to the name of the
`PlatformTransactionManager` bean that is going to __drive__ the transactions, in this
case, the `txManager` bean.

[TIP]
====

You can omit the `transaction-manager` attribute in the transactional advice (
`<tx:advice/>`) if the bean name of the `PlatformTransactionManager` that you want to
wire in has the name `transactionManager`. If the `PlatformTransactionManager` bean that
you want to wire in has any other name, then you must use the `transaction-manager`
attribute explicitly, as in the preceding example.
====

The `<aop:config/>` definition ensures that the transactional advice defined by the
`txAdvice` bean executes at the appropriate points in the program. First you define a
pointcut that matches the execution of any operation defined in the `FooService`
interface ( `fooServiceOperation`). Then you associate the pointcut with the `txAdvice`
using an advisor. The result indicates that at the execution of a `fooServiceOperation`,
the advice defined by `txAdvice` will be run.

The expression defined within the `<aop:pointcut/>` element is an AspectJ pointcut
expression; see <<aop>> for more details on pointcut expressions in Spring.

A common requirement is to make an entire service layer transactional. The best way to
do this is simply to change the pointcut expression to match any operation in your
service layer. For example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
	<aop:config>
		<aop:pointcut id="fooServiceMethods" expression="execution(* x.y.service.*.*(..))"/>
		<aop:advisor advice-ref="txAdvice" pointcut-ref="fooServiceMethods"/>
	</aop:config>
----

[NOTE]
====
__In this example it is assumed that all your service interfaces are defined in the
`x.y.service` package; see <<aop>> for more details.__
====

Now that we've analyzed the configuration, you may be asking yourself, "__Okay... but
what does all this configuration actually do?__".

The above configuration will be used to create a transactional proxy around the object
that is created from the `fooService` bean definition. The proxy will be configured with
the transactional advice, so that when an appropriate method is invoked __on the
proxy__, a transaction is started, suspended, marked as read-only, and so on, depending
on the transaction configuration associated with that method. Consider the following
program that test drives the above configuration:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public final class Boot {

		public static void main(final String[] args) throws Exception {
			ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("context.xml", Boot.class);
			FooService fooService = (FooService) ctx.getBean("fooService");
			fooService.insertFoo (new Foo());
		}

[[transaction-declarative-rolling-back]]
==== Rolling back a declarative transaction
The previous section outlined the basics of how to specify transactional settings for
classes, typically service layer classes, declaratively in your application. This
section describes how you can control the rollback of transactions in a simple
declarative fashion.

The recommended way to indicate to the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure
that a transaction's work is to be rolled back is to throw an `Exception` from code that
is currently executing in the context of a transaction. The Spring Framework's
transaction infrastructure code will catch any unhandled `Exception` as it bubbles up
the call stack, and make a determination whether to mark the transaction for rollback.

In its default configuration, the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure code
__only__ marks a transaction for rollback in the case of runtime, unchecked exceptions;
that is, when the thrown exception is an instance or subclass of `RuntimeException`. (
++Error++s will also - by default - result in a rollback). Checked exceptions that are
thrown from a transactional method do __not__ result in rollback in the default
configuration.

You can configure exactly which `Exception` types mark a transaction for rollback,
including checked exceptions. The following XML snippet demonstrates how you configure
rollback for a checked, application-specific `Exception` type.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="txManager">
		<tx:attributes>
		<tx:method name="get*" read-only="true" rollback-for="NoProductInStockException"/>
		<tx:method name="*"/>
		</tx:attributes>
	</tx:advice>
----

You can also specify 'no rollback rules', if you do __not__ want a transaction rolled
back when an exception is thrown. The following example tells the Spring Framework's
transaction infrastructure to commit the attendant transaction even in the face of an
unhandled `InstrumentNotFoundException`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<tx:advice id="txAdvice">
		<tx:attributes>
		<tx:method name="updateStock" no-rollback-for="InstrumentNotFoundException"/>
		<tx:method name="*"/>
		</tx:attributes>
	</tx:advice>
----

When the Spring Framework's transaction infrastructure catches an exception and is
consults configured rollback rules to determine whether to mark the transaction for
rollback, the __strongest__ matching rule wins. So in the case of the following
configuration, any exception other than an `InstrumentNotFoundException` results in a
rollback of the attendant transaction.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<tx:advice id="txAdvice">
		<tx:attributes>
		<tx:method name="*" rollback-for="Throwable" no-rollback-for="InstrumentNotFoundException"/>
		</tx:attributes>
	</tx:advice>
----

You can also indicate a required rollback __programmatically__. Although very simple,
this process is quite invasive, and tightly couples your code to the Spring Framework's
transaction infrastructure:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public void resolvePosition() {
		try {
			// some business logic...
		} catch (NoProductInStockException ex) {
			// trigger rollback programmatically
			TransactionAspectSupport.currentTransactionStatus().setRollbackOnly();
		}
	}
----

You are strongly encouraged to use the declarative approach to rollback if at all
possible. Programmatic rollback is available should you absolutely need it, but its
usage flies in the face of achieving a clean POJO-based architecture.



[[transaction-declarative-diff-tx]]
==== Configuring different transactional semantics for different beans
Consider the scenario where you have a number of service layer objects, and you want to
apply a __totally different__ transactional configuration to each of them. You do this
by defining distinct `<aop:advisor/>` elements with differing `pointcut` and
`advice-ref` attribute values.

As a point of comparison, first assume that all of your service layer classes are
defined in a root `x.y.service` package. To make all beans that are instances of classes
defined in that package (or in subpackages) and that have names ending in `Service` have
the default transactional configuration, you would write the following:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

		<aop:config>

			<aop:pointcut id="serviceOperation"
					expression="execution(* x.y.service..*Service.*(..))"/>

			<aop:advisor pointcut-ref="serviceOperation" advice-ref="txAdvice"/>

		</aop:config>

		<!-- these two beans will be transactional... -->
		<bean id="fooService" class="x.y.service.DefaultFooService"/>
		<bean id="barService" class="x.y.service.extras.SimpleBarService"/>

		<!-- ... and these two beans won't -->
		<bean id="anotherService" class="org.xyz.SomeService"/> <!-- (not in the right package) -->
		<bean id="barManager" class="x.y.service.SimpleBarManager"/> <!-- (doesn't end in 'Service') -->

		<tx:advice id="txAdvice">
			<tx:attributes>
				<tx:method name="get*" read-only="true"/>
				<tx:method name="*"/>
			</tx:attributes>
		</tx:advice>

		<!-- other transaction infrastructure beans such as a PlatformTransactionManager omitted... -->

	</beans>
----

The following example shows how to configure two distinct beans with totally different
transactional settings.

[[transaction-declarative-txadvice-settings]]
==== <tx:advice/> settings

This section summarizes the various transactional settings that can be specified using
the `<tx:advice/>` tag. The default `<tx:advice/>` settings are:

* <<tx-propagation,Propagation setting>> is `REQUIRED.`
* Isolation level is `DEFAULT.`
* Transaction is read/write.
* Transaction timeout defaults to the default timeout of the underlying transaction
  system, or none if timeouts are not supported.
* Any `RuntimeException` triggers rollback, and any checked `Exception` does not.

You can change these default settings; the various attributes of the `<tx:method/>` tags
that are nested within `<tx:advice/>` and `<tx:attributes/>` tags are summarized below:

[[tx-method-settings]]
.<tx:method/> settings
|===
| Attribute| Required?| Default| Description

| `name`
| Yes
|
| Method name(s) with which the transaction attributes are to be associated. The
  wildcard (*) character can be used to associate the same transaction attribute
  settings with a number of methods; for example, `get*`, `handle*`, `on*Event`, and so
  forth.

| `propagation`
| No
| REQUIRED
| Transaction propagation behavior.

| `isolation`
| No
| DEFAULT
| Transaction isolation level.

| `timeout`
| No
| -1
| Transaction timeout value (in seconds).

| `read-only`
| No
| false
| Is this transaction read-only?

| `rollback-for`
| No
|
| `Exception(s)` that trigger rollback; comma-delimited. For example,
  `com.foo.MyBusinessException,ServletException.`

| `no-rollback-for`
| No
|
| `Exception(s)` that do __not__ trigger rollback; comma-delimited. For example,
  `com.foo.MyBusinessException,ServletException.`
|===



[[transaction-declarative-annotations]]
==== Using @Transactional

In addition to the XML-based declarative approach to transaction configuration, you can
use an annotation-based approach. Declaring transaction semantics directly in the Java
source code puts the declarations much closer to the affected code. There is not much
danger of undue coupling, because code that is meant to be used transactionally is
almost always deployed that way anyway.

The ease-of-use afforded by the use of the `@Transactional` annotation is best
illustrated with an example, which is explained in the text that follows. Consider the
following class definition:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// the service class that we want to make transactional
	**@Transactional**
	public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

		Foo getFoo(String fooName);

		Foo getFoo(String fooName, String barName);

		void insertFoo(Foo foo);

		void updateFoo(Foo foo);
	}
----

When the above POJO is defined as a bean in a Spring IoC container, the bean instance
can be made transactional by adding merely __one__ line of XML configuration:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<!-- from the file 'context.xml' -->
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"

		xmlns:tx="http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx"
		xsi:schemaLocation="
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx/spring-tx.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-aop.xsd">

		<!-- this is the service object that we want to make transactional -->
		<bean id="fooService" class="x.y.service.DefaultFooService"/>

		<!-- enable the configuration of transactional behavior based on annotations -->
		__<tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager="txManager"/>__<!-- a PlatformTransactionManager is still required -->
		<bean id="txManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
			<!-- (this dependency is defined somewhere else) -->
			<property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
		</bean>

		<!-- other <bean/> definitions here -->

	</beans>
----

[TIP]
====
You can omit the `transaction-manager` attribute in the `<tx:annotation-driven/>` tag if
the bean name of the `PlatformTransactionManager` that you want to wire in has the name
`transactionManager`. If the `PlatformTransactionManager` bean that you want to
dependency-inject has any other name, then you have to use the `transaction-manager`
attribute explicitly, as in the preceding example.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `@EnableTransactionManagement` annotation provides equivalent support if you are
using Java based configuration. Simply add the annotation to a `@Configuration` class.
See the javadocs for full details.
====

.Method visibility and @Transactional
****
When using proxies, you should apply the `@Transactional` annotation only to methods
with __public__ visibility. If you do annotate protected, private or package-visible
methods with the `@Transactional` annotation, no error is raised, but the annotated
method does not exhibit the configured transactional settings. Consider the use of
AspectJ (see below) if you need to annotate non-public methods.
****

You can place the `@Transactional` annotation before an interface definition, a method
on an interface, a class definition, or a __public__ method on a class. However, the
mere presence of the `@Transactional` annotation is not enough to activate the
transactional behavior. The `@Transactional` annotation is simply metadata that can be
consumed by some runtime infrastructure that is `@Transactional`-aware and that can use
the metadata to configure the appropriate beans with transactional behavior. In the
preceding example, the `<tx:annotation-driven/>` element __switches on__ the
transactional behavior.

[TIP]
====

Spring recommends that you only annotate concrete classes (and methods of concrete
classes) with the `@Transactional` annotation, as opposed to annotating interfaces. You
certainly can place the `@Transactional` annotation on an interface (or an interface
method), but this works only as you would expect it to if you are using interface-based
proxies. The fact that Java annotations are __not inherited from interfaces__ means that
if you are using class-based proxies ( `proxy-target-class="true"`) or the weaving-based
aspect ( `mode="aspectj"`), then the transaction settings are not recognized by the
proxying and weaving infrastructure, and the object will not be wrapped in a
transactional proxy, which would be decidedly __bad__.
====

[NOTE]
====
In proxy mode (which is the default), only external method calls coming in through the
proxy are intercepted. This means that self-invocation, in effect, a method within the
target object calling another method of the target object, will not lead to an actual
transaction at runtime even if the invoked method is marked with `@Transactional`.
====

Consider the use of AspectJ mode (see mode attribute in table below) if you expect
self-invocations to be wrapped with transactions as well. In this case, there will not
be a proxy in the first place; instead, the target class will be weaved (that is, its
byte code will be modified) in order to turn `@Transactional` into runtime behavior on
any kind of method.

[[tx-annotation-driven-settings]]
.Annotation driven transaction settings
|===
| XML Attribute| Annotation Attribute| Default| Description

| `transaction-manager`
| N/A (See `TransactionManagementConfigurer` javadocs)
| transactionManager
| Name of transaction manager to use. Only required if the name of the transaction
  manager is not `transactionManager`, as in the example above.

| `mode`
| `mode`
| proxy
| The default mode "proxy" processes annotated beans to be proxied using Spring's AOP
  framework (following proxy semantics, as discussed above, applying to method calls
  coming in through the proxy only). The alternative mode "aspectj" instead weaves the
  affected classes with Spring's AspectJ transaction aspect, modifying the target class
  byte code to apply to any kind of method call. AspectJ weaving requires
  spring-aspects.jar in the classpath as well as load-time weaving (or compile-time
  weaving) enabled. (See <<aop-aj-ltw-spring>> for details on how to set up load-time
  weaving.)

| `proxy-target-class`
| `proxyTargetClass`
| false
| Applies to proxy mode only. Controls what type of transactional proxies are created
  for classes annotated with the `@Transactional` annotation. If the
  `proxy-target-class` attribute is set to `true`, then class-based proxies are created.
  If `proxy-target-class` is `false` or if the attribute is omitted, then standard JDK
  interface-based proxies are created. (See <<aop-proxying>> for a detailed examination
  of the different proxy types.)

| `order`
| `order`
| Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE
| Defines the order of the transaction advice that is applied to beans annotated with
  `@Transactional`. (For more information about the rules related to ordering of AOP
  advice, see <<aop-ataspectj-advice-ordering>>.) No specified ordering means that the
  AOP subsystem determines the order of the advice.
|===

[NOTE]
====
The `proxy-target-class` attribute controls what type of transactional proxies are
created for classes annotated with the `@Transactional` annotation. If
`proxy-target-class` is set to `true`, class-based proxies are created. If
`proxy-target-class` is `false` or if the attribute is omitted, standard JDK
interface-based proxies are created. (See <<aop-proxying>> for a discussion of the
different proxy types.)
====

[NOTE]
====
`@EnableTransactionManagement` and `<tx:annotation-driven/>` only looks for
`@Transactional` on beans in the same application context they are defined in. This
means that, if you put annotation driven configuration in a `WebApplicationContext` for
a `DispatcherServlet`, it only checks for `@Transactional` beans in your controllers,
and not your services. See <<mvc-servlet>> for more information.
====

The most derived location takes precedence when evaluating the transactional settings
for a method. In the case of the following example, the `DefaultFooService` class is
annotated at the class level with the settings for a read-only transaction, but the
`@Transactional` annotation on the `updateFoo(Foo)` method in the same class takes
precedence over the transactional settings defined at the class level.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Transactional(readOnly = true)
	public class DefaultFooService implements FooService {

		public Foo getFoo(String fooName) {
			// do something
		}

		// these settings have precedence for this method
		@Transactional(readOnly = false, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
		public void updateFoo(Foo foo) {
			// do something
		}
	}
----


[[transaction-declarative-attransactional-settings]]
===== @Transactional settings

The `@Transactional` annotation is metadata that specifies that an interface, class, or
method must have transactional semantics; for example, "__start a brand new read-only
transaction when this method is invoked, suspending any existing transaction__". The
default `@Transactional` settings are as follows:

* Propagation setting is `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED.`
* Isolation level is `ISOLATION_DEFAULT.`
* Transaction is read/write.
* Transaction timeout defaults to the default timeout of the underlying transaction
  system, or to none if timeouts are not supported.
* Any `RuntimeException` triggers rollback, and any checked `Exception` does not.

These default settings can be changed; the various properties of the `@Transactional`
annotation are summarized in the following table:

[[tx-attransactional-properties]]
.@
|===
| Property| Type| Description

| <<tx-multiple-tx-mgrs-with-attransactional,value>>
| String
|  Optional qualifier specifying the transaction manager to be used.

| <<tx-propagation,propagation>>
| enum: `Propagation`
| Optional propagation setting.

| `isolation`
| enum: `Isolation`
| Optional isolation level.

| `readOnly`
| boolean
| Read/write vs. read-only transaction

| `timeout`
| int (in seconds granularity)
| Transaction timeout.

| `rollbackFor`
| Array of `Class` objects, which must be derived from `Throwable.`
| Optional array of exception classes that __must__ cause rollback.

| `rollbackForClassName`
| Array of class names. Classes must be derived from `Throwable.`
| Optional array of names of exception classes that __must__ cause rollback.

| `noRollbackFor`
| Array of `Class` objects, which must be derived from `Throwable.`
| Optional array of exception classes that __must not__ cause rollback.

| `noRollbackForClassName`
| Array of `String` class names, which must be derived from `Throwable.`
| Optional array of names of exception classes that __must not__ cause rollback.
|===

Currently you cannot have explicit control over the name of a transaction, where 'name'
means the transaction name that will be shown in a transaction monitor, if applicable
(for example, WebLogic's transaction monitor), and in logging output. For declarative
transactions, the transaction name is always the fully-qualified class name + "."
+ method name of the transactionally-advised class. For example, if the
`handlePayment(..)` method of the `BusinessService` class started a transaction, the
name of the transaction would be: `com.foo.BusinessService.handlePayment`.


[[tx-multiple-tx-mgrs-with-attransactional]]
===== Multiple Transaction Managers with @Transactional
Most Spring applications only need a single transaction manager, but there may be
situations where you want multiple independent transaction managers in a single
application. The value attribute of the `@Transactional` annotation can be used to
optionally specify the identity of the `PlatformTransactionManager` to be used. This can
either be the bean name or the qualifier value of the transaction manager bean. For
example, using the qualifier notation, the following Java code

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class TransactionalService {

		@Transactional("order")
		public void setSomething(String name) { ... }

		@Transactional("account")
		public void doSomething() { ... }
	}
----

could be combined with the following transaction manager bean declarations in the
application context.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<tx:annotation-driven/>

		<bean id="transactionManager1" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
			...
			<qualifier value="order"/>
		</bean>

		<bean id="transactionManager2" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">
			...
			<qualifier value="account"/>
		</bean>
----

In this case, the two methods on `TransactionalService` will run under separate
transaction managers, differentiated by the "order" and "account" qualifiers. The
default `<tx:annotation-driven>` target bean name `transactionManager` will still be
used if no specifically qualified PlatformTransactionManager bean is found.


[[tx-custom-attributes]]
===== Custom shortcut annotations
If you find you are repeatedly using the same attributes with `@Transactional` on many
different methods, then <<beans-meta-annotations,Spring's meta-annotation support>> allows
you to define custom shortcut annotations for your specific use cases. For example,
defining the following annotations

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
	@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
	@Transactional("order")
	public @interface OrderTx {
	}

	@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE})
	@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
	@Transactional("account")
	public @interface AccountTx {
	}
----

allows us to write the example from the previous section as

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class TransactionalService {

		@OrderTx
		public void setSomething(String name) { ... }

		@AccountTx
		public void doSomething() { ... }
	}
----

Here we have used the syntax to define the transaction manager qualifier, but could also
have included propagation behavior, rollback rules, timeouts etc.



[[tx-propagation]]
==== Transaction propagation
This section describes some semantics of transaction propagation in Spring. Please note
that this section is not an introduction to transaction propagation proper; rather it
details some of the semantics regarding transaction propagation in Spring.

In Spring-managed transactions, be aware of the difference between __physical__ and
__logical__ transactions, and how the propagation setting applies to this difference.


[[tx-propagation-required]]
===== Required
image::images/tx_prop_required.png[width=400]

PROPAGATION_REQUIRED

When the propagation setting is `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`, a __logical__ transaction scope
is created for each method upon which the setting is applied. Each such logical
transaction scope can determine rollback-only status individually, with an outer
transaction scope being logically independent from the inner transaction scope. Of
course, in case of standard `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED` behavior, all these scopes will be
mapped to the same physical transaction. So a rollback-only marker set in the inner
transaction scope does affect the outer transaction's chance to actually commit (as you
would expect it to).

However, in the case where an inner transaction scope sets the rollback-only marker, the
outer transaction has not decided on the rollback itself, and so the rollback (silently
triggered by the inner transaction scope) is unexpected. A corresponding
`UnexpectedRollbackException` is thrown at that point. This is __expected behavior__ so
that the caller of a transaction can never be misled to assume that a commit was
performed when it really was not. So if an inner transaction (of which the outer caller
is not aware) silently marks a transaction as rollback-only, the outer caller still
calls commit. The outer caller needs to receive an `UnexpectedRollbackException` to
indicate clearly that a rollback was performed instead.


[[tx-propagation-requires_new]]
===== RequiresNew
image::images/tx_prop_requires_new.png[width=400]

PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW

`PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW`, in contrast to `PROPAGATION_REQUIRED`, uses a __completely__
independent transaction for each affected transaction scope. In that case, the
underlying physical transactions are different and hence can commit or roll back
independently, with an outer transaction not affected by an inner transaction's rollback
status.


[[tx-propagation-nested]]
===== Nested
`PROPAGATION_NESTED` uses a __single__ physical transaction with multiple savepoints
that it can roll back to. Such partial rollbacks allow an inner transaction scope to
trigger a rollback __for its scope__, with the outer transaction being able to continue
the physical transaction despite some operations having been rolled back. This setting
is typically mapped onto JDBC savepoints, so will only work with JDBC resource
transactions. See Spring's `DataSourceTransactionManager`.



[[transaction-declarative-applying-more-than-just-tx-advice]]
==== Advising transactional operations
Suppose you want to execute __both__ transactional __and__ some basic profiling advice.
How do you effect this in the context of `<tx:annotation-driven/>`?

When you invoke the `updateFoo(Foo)` method, you want to see the following actions:

* Configured profiling aspect starts up.
* Transactional advice executes.
* Method on the advised object executes.
* Transaction commits.
* Profiling aspect reports exact duration of the whole transactional method invocation.

[NOTE]
====
This chapter is not concerned with explaining AOP in any great detail (except as it
applies to transactions). See <<aop>> for detailed coverage of the following AOP
configuration and AOP in general.
====

Here is the code for a simple profiling aspect discussed above. The ordering of advice
is controlled through the `Ordered` interface. For full details on advice ordering, see
<<aop-ataspectj-advice-ordering>>.

The result of the above configuration is a `fooService` bean that has profiling and

of additional aspects in similar fashion.

The following example effects the same setup as above, but uses the purely XML
declarative approach.

----

The result of the above configuration will be a `fooService` bean that has profiling and
transactional aspects applied to it __in that order__. If you want the profiling advice
to execute __after__ the transactional advice on the way in, and __before__ the
transactional advice on the way out, then you simply swap the value of the profiling
aspect bean's `order` property so that it is higher than the transactional advice's
order value.

You configure additional aspects in similar fashion.



[[transaction-declarative-aspectj]]
==== Using @Transactional with AspectJ

It is also possible to use the Spring Framework's `@Transactional` support outside of a
Spring container by means of an AspectJ aspect. To do so, you first annotate your
classes (and optionally your classes' methods) with the `@Transactional` annotation, and
then you link (weave) your application with the
`org.springframework.transaction.aspectj.AnnotationTransactionAspect` defined in the
`spring-aspects.jar` file. The aspect must also be configured with a transaction
manager. You can of course use the Spring Framework's IoC container to take care of
dependency-injecting the aspect. The simplest way to configure the transaction
management aspect is to use the `<tx:annotation-driven/>` element and specify the `mode`
attribute to `aspectj` as described in <<transaction-declarative-annotations>>. Because
we're focusing here on applications running outside of a Spring container, we'll show
you how to do it programmatically.

[NOTE]
====
Prior to continuing, you may want to read <<transaction-declarative-annotations>> and
<<aop>> respectively.
====

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// construct an appropriate transaction manager
	DataSourceTransactionManager txManager = new DataSourceTransactionManager(getDataSource());

	// configure the AnnotationTransactionAspect to use it; this must be done before executing any transactional methods
	AnnotationTransactionAspect.aspectOf().setTransactionManager(txManager);
----

[NOTE]
====
When using this aspect, you must annotate the __implementation__ class (and/or methods
within that class), __not__ the interface (if any) that the class implements. AspectJ
follows Java's rule that annotations on interfaces are __not inherited__.
====

The `@Transactional` annotation on a class specifies the default transaction semantics
for the execution of any method in the class.

The `@Transactional` annotation on a method within the class overrides the default
transaction semantics given by the class annotation (if present). Any method may be
annotated, regardless of visibility.

To weave your applications with the `AnnotationTransactionAspect` you must either build
your application with AspectJ (see the
http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/devguide/index.html[AspectJ Development
Guide]) or use load-time weaving. See <<aop-aj-ltw>> for a discussion of load-time
weaving with AspectJ.




[[transaction-programmatic]]
=== Programmatic transaction management
The Spring Framework provides two means of programmatic transaction management:

* Using the `TransactionTemplate`.
* Using a `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation directly.

The Spring team generally recommends the `TransactionTemplate` for programmatic
transaction management. The second approach is similar to using the JTA
`UserTransaction` API, although exception handling is less cumbersome.



[[tx-prog-template]]
==== Using the TransactionTemplate

The `TransactionTemplate` adopts the same approach as other Spring __templates__ such as
the `JdbcTemplate`. It uses a callback approach, to free application code from having to
do the boilerplate acquisition and release of transactional resources, and results in
code that is intention driven, in that the code that is written focuses solely on what
the developer wants to do.

[NOTE]
====
As you will see in the examples that follow, using the `TransactionTemplate` absolutely
couples you to Spring's transaction infrastructure and APIs. Whether or not programmatic
transaction management is suitable for your development needs is a decision that you
will have to make yourself.
====

Application code that must execute in a transactional context, and that will use the
`TransactionTemplate` explicitly, looks like the following. You, as an application
developer, write a `TransactionCallback` implementation (typically expressed as an
anonymous inner class) that contains the code that you need to execute in the context of
a transaction. You then pass an instance of your custom `TransactionCallback` to the
`execute(..)` method exposed on the `TransactionTemplate`.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class SimpleService implements Service {

		// single TransactionTemplate shared amongst all methods in this instance
		private final TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;

		// use constructor-injection to supply the PlatformTransactionManager
		public SimpleService(PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) {
			Assert.notNull(transactionManager, "The ''transactionManager'' argument must not be null.");
			this.transactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
		}

		public Object someServiceMethod() {
			return transactionTemplate.execute(new TransactionCallback() {
				// the code in this method executes in a transactional context
				public Object doInTransaction(TransactionStatus status) {
					updateOperation1();
					return resultOfUpdateOperation2();
				}
			});
		}
	}
----

If there is no return value, use the convenient `TransactionCallbackWithoutResult` class
with an anonymous class as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	transactionTemplate.execute(new **TransactionCallbackWithoutResult**() {
		protected void doInTransactionWithoutResult(TransactionStatus status) {
			updateOperation1();
			updateOperation2();
		}
	});
----

Code within the callback can roll the transaction back by calling the
`setRollbackOnly()` method on the supplied `TransactionStatus` object:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	transactionTemplate.execute(new TransactionCallbackWithoutResult() {

		protected void doInTransactionWithoutResult(TransactionStatus status) {
			try {
				updateOperation1();
				updateOperation2();
			} catch (SomeBusinessExeption ex) {
				**status.setRollbackOnly();**
			}
		}
	});
----


[[tx-prog-template-settings]]
===== Specifying transaction settings
You can specify transaction settings such as the propagation mode, the isolation level,
the timeout, and so forth on the `TransactionTemplate` either programmatically or in
configuration. `TransactionTemplate` instances by default have the
<<transaction-declarative-txadvice-settings,default transactional settings>>. The
following example shows the programmatic customization of the transactional settings for
a specific `TransactionTemplate:`

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	public class SimpleService implements Service {

		private final TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;

		public SimpleService(PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) {
			Assert.notNull(transactionManager, "The ''transactionManager'' argument must not be null.");
			this.transactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);

			// the transaction settings can be set here explicitly if so desired
			this.transactionTemplate.setIsolationLevel(TransactionDefinition.ISOLATION_READ_UNCOMMITTED);
			this.transactionTemplate.setTimeout(30); // 30 seconds
			// and so forth...
		}
	}
----

The following example defines a `TransactionTemplate` with some custom transactional
settings, using Spring XML configuration. The `sharedTransactionTemplate` can then be
injected into as many services as are required.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="sharedTransactionTemplate"
			class="org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionTemplate">
		<property name="isolationLevelName" value="ISOLATION_READ_UNCOMMITTED"/>
		<property name="timeout" value="30"/>
	</bean>"
----

Finally, instances of the `TransactionTemplate` class are threadsafe, in that instances
do not maintain any conversational state. `TransactionTemplate` instances __do__ however
maintain configuration state, so while a number of classes may share a single instance
of a `TransactionTemplate`, if a class needs to use a `TransactionTemplate` with
different settings (for example, a different isolation level), then you need to create
two distinct `TransactionTemplate` instances.



[[transaction-programmatic-ptm]]
==== Using the PlatformTransactionManager

You can also use the `org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager`
directly to manage your transaction. Simply pass the implementation of the
`PlatformTransactionManager` you are using to your bean through a bean reference. Then,
using the `TransactionDefinition` and `TransactionStatus` objects you can initiate
transactions, roll back, and commit.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	DefaultTransactionDefinition def = new DefaultTransactionDefinition();
	// explicitly setting the transaction name is something that can only be done programmatically
	def.setName("SomeTxName");
	def.setPropagationBehavior(TransactionDefinition.PROPAGATION_REQUIRED);

	TransactionStatus status = txManager.getTransaction(def);
	try {
		// execute your business logic here
	}
	catch (MyException ex) {
		txManager.rollback(status);
		throw ex;
	}
	txManager.commit(status);
----




[[tx-decl-vs-prog]]
=== Choosing between programmatic and declarative transaction management
Programmatic transaction management is usually a good idea only if you have a small
number of transactional operations. For example, if you have a web application that
require transactions only for certain update operations, you may not want to set up
transactional proxies using Spring or any other technology. In this case, using the
`TransactionTemplate` __may__ be a good approach. Being able to set the transaction name
explicitly is also something that can only be done using the programmatic approach to
transaction management.

On the other hand, if your application has numerous transactional operations,
declarative transaction management is usually worthwhile. It keeps transaction
management out of business logic, and is not difficult to configure. When using the
Spring Framework, rather than EJB CMT, the configuration cost of declarative transaction
management is greatly reduced.




[[transaction-application-server-integration]]
=== Application server-specific integration
Spring's transaction abstraction generally is application server agnostic. Additionally,
Spring's `JtaTransactionManager` class, which can optionally perform a JNDI lookup for
the JTA `UserTransaction` and `TransactionManager` objects, autodetects the location for
the latter object, which varies by application server. Having access to the JTA
`TransactionManager` allows for enhanced transaction semantics, in particular supporting
transaction suspension. See the `JtaTransactionManager` javadocs for details.

Spring's `JtaTransactionManager` is the standard choice to run on Java EE application
servers, and is known to work on all common servers. Advanced functionality such as
transaction suspension works on many servers as well -- including GlassFish, JBoss and
Geronimo -- without any special configuration required. However, for fully supported
transaction suspension and further advanced integration, Spring ships special adapters
for WebLogic Server and WebSphere. These adapters are discussed in the following
sections.

__For standard scenarios, including WebLogic Server and WebSphere, consider using the
convenient `<tx:jta-transaction-manager/>` configuration element.__ When configured,
this element automatically detects the underlying server and chooses the best
transaction manager available for the platform. This means that you won't have to
configure server-specific adapter classes (as discussed in the following sections)
explicitly; rather, they are chosen automatically, with the standard
`JtaTransactionManager` as default fallback.



[[transaction-application-server-integration-websphere]]
==== IBM WebSphere
On WebSphere 6.1.0.9 and above, the recommended Spring JTA transaction manager to use is
`WebSphereUowTransactionManager`. This special adapter leverages IBM's `UOWManager` API,
which is available in WebSphere Application Server 6.0.2.19 and later and 6.1.0.9 and
later. With this adapter, Spring-driven transaction suspension (suspend/resume as
initiated by `PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW`) is officially supported by IBM!



[[transaction-application-server-integration-weblogic]]
==== Oracle WebLogic Server
On WebLogic Server 9.0 or above, you typically would use the
`WebLogicJtaTransactionManager` instead of the stock `JtaTransactionManager` class. This
special WebLogic-specific subclass of the normal `JtaTransactionManager` supports the
full power of Spring's transaction definitions in a WebLogic-managed transaction
environment, beyond standard JTA semantics: Features include transaction names,
per-transaction isolation levels, and proper resuming of transactions in all cases.




[[transaction-solutions-to-common-problems]]
=== Solutions to common problems



[[transaction-solutions-to-common-problems-wrong-ptm]]
==== Use of the wrong transaction manager for a specific DataSource

Use the __correct__ `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation based on your choice of
transactional technologies and requirements. Used properly, the Spring Framework merely
provides a straightforward and portable abstraction. If you are using global
transactions, you __must__ use the
`org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager` class (or an
<<transaction-application-server-integration,application server-specific subclass>> of
it) for all your transactional operations. Otherwise the transaction infrastructure
attempts to perform local transactions on resources such as container `DataSource`
instances. Such local transactions do not make sense, and a good application server
treats them as errors.
